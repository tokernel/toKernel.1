 About project
 -------------

 Fully Object-Oriented extensible framework to make website or CMS development simple and flexible.

 toKernel is a fully Object-Oriented extensible framework written in PHP.
 By design, the framework's kernel is monolithic which brings a lot 
 of advantages. It is NOT a loader for a mere collection of classes.
 The versatility of this framework allows you to create web
 applications, command line applications and run the same application
 in either mode including interactive mode.
